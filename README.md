# Drowsiness-Detection

Each year, drowsy driving accounts for about 100,000 crashes, 71,000 injuries and 1,550 fatalities, according to the National Safety Council (NSC). In addition, a study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drowsiness was a contributing factor in up to 9.5 percent of all crashes and 10.8 percent of crashes that included airbag deployment, injury or significant property damage. 

Car companies can develop a drowsiness detection in their vehicles to alert drivers when they start to fall asleep at the wheel.

<p>For the modeling section I split the modeling into two models. The Closd/Open model is based on if someone's eyes are closed or open. The Yawn/No Yawn is based on if a driver is yawning or not.</p>
